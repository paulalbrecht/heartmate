Certain metrics need to be tracked for a left valve assisstance device (heart pump): Pump Speed, Flow, Pulse Index, Power. This could simply be accomplished with a spreadsheet. But I decided to use it as an oppurtunity learn some things. My plan is to use Rails, which I have never used before, React which I have very little experience with, absolutely no bootstrap/jquery etc, a complete CI/CD pipeline which I have some experience with in pieces. 

I want to make this a challenge by bringing a bunch of things I don't know all together. I like the "learn by doing" approach.

Specific ideas:
the main dashboard will maybe have some sort of graph, a table of the listed values for the current month, pagination by month, outlier numbers will be yellow for a warning, red for danger.
